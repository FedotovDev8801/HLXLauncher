# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

HLXLauncher uses an auto update system (from ATLauncher), and as such we only support the latest version of our software.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please start by emailing the details to [FedotovDev](mailto:fedotovdev.8801@proton.me) and we can take it from there.

You may also choose to privately discuss it on Discord (`flameguy88gg`) [(our Discord server)](https://discord.gg/zEGHrrFfsD) via DMs.

Please don't discuss anything publically in the Discord until we have assessed the vulnerability.
